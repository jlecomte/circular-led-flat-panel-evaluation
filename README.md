# Circular LED Flat Panel Evaluation

This GNU Octave simulation shows the light intensity map of a light panel created by using a circular strip of LEDs. It also outputs the intensity difference as a percentage between the brightest and the dimmest points.

```bash
$ octave simulator.m
Maximum intensity difference is 32.6%
```
